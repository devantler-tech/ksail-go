# Feature Specification: CLI Command Timing

**Feature Branch**: `005-implement-timing-in`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement timing in the cli via a new package pkg/ui/timer. The timer should be used to estimate elapsed time of each command and its stages. A stage is defined by a new title. The timing must be printed in the following format [x total|x stage] where x is the time in go duration format. The timing must be printed in success messages. This is important to allow users to monitor how long commands and their individual stages take to run."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a KSail user, when I run any CLI command (e.g., `ksail cluster up`, `ksail init`), I want to see how long the command takes and how long each stage within that command takes, so that I can monitor performance, identify slow operations, and understand where time is being spent during cluster provisioning and management operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user runs `ksail cluster up`, **When** the command completes successfully, **Then** the success message displays timing information in the format `[5m30s total|2m15s stage]` showing both total elapsed time and the time for the final stage

2. **Given** a user runs `ksail init --distribution Kind`, **When** the command completes successfully, **Then** the success message displays timing in the format `[1.2s total|1.2s stage]` with appropriate precision for sub-second operations

3. **Given** a command has multiple stages (e.g., "Initializing cluster", "Installing CNI", "Deploying workloads"), **When** each stage completes, **Then** the timing for that specific stage is tracked and the cumulative total time is maintained

4. **Given** a user runs any KSail command, **When** viewing the output, **Then** stage boundaries are clearly defined by title changes in the UI output

5. **Given** a long-running command with multiple stages, **When** intermediate stages complete, **Then** users can see the duration of each completed stage to understand progress

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a command completes in less than 1 millisecond? (timing should handle sub-millisecond precision)
- What happens when a stage has no explicit title change? (should default to tracking the command as a single stage)
- What happens when a command fails mid-execution? (timing should still be captured up to the point of failure)
- How does timing behave with parallel operations within a command? (timing should track wall-clock time, not cumulative CPU time)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a timer utility that tracks elapsed time for CLI commands from start to completion

- **FR-002**: System MUST track elapsed time for individual stages within a command, where a stage is defined by a title change in the output

- **FR-003**: System MUST display timing information in success messages using the format `[X total|Y stage]` where X is total elapsed time and Y is the last stage's elapsed time

- **FR-004**: System MUST format timing durations using Go's duration format (e.g., `1m30s`, `500ms`, `2.5s`)

- **FR-005**: System MUST allow commands to define stage boundaries by setting new titles during execution

- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain cumulative total time across all stages within a command execution

- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a mechanism to start timing when a command begins execution

- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a mechanism to mark stage transitions when titles change

- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a mechanism to stop timing when a command completes

- **FR-010**: System MUST format timing information to be human-readable and consistent across all commands

- **FR-011**: Timing information MUST be included in all success messages for all KSail commands

- **FR-012**: System MUST handle sub-second durations with appropriate precision (milliseconds for <1s operations)

- **FR-013**: System MUST handle long-running operations (minutes, hours) with appropriate formatting

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Timer**: Represents the timing tracker for a command execution. Tracks start time, current stage start time, and provides methods to calculate elapsed durations.

- **Stage**: Represents a logical phase within a command execution, defined by a title. Has a start time and duration once completed.

- **Timing Metadata**: The formatted string containing total and stage timing information in the format `[X total|Y stage]`.

## Notes

**User Value**: This feature directly addresses user feedback about understanding performance characteristics of KSail operations. Users running cluster provisioning operations (which can take several minutes) benefit from visibility into where time is spent, enabling them to:

1. Set appropriate expectations for command execution times
2. Identify performance bottlenecks or slow stages
3. Compare timing across different distributions (Kind vs K3d vs EKS)
4. Debug and troubleshoot slow operations

**Scope Boundaries**: This specification focuses solely on timing display for successful command completions. Error scenarios, performance optimization of the timing mechanism itself, and detailed profiling/tracing are out of scope for this feature.

**Testing Approach**: Acceptance tests should verify timing format correctness, stage boundary tracking, and consistent display across all commands. Performance tests should ensure the timing mechanism adds negligible overhead (<1ms) to command execution.
