# Phase 0: Research - Configuration File Validation

## Research Areas and Decisions

### 1. Validation Architecture Patterns

**Decision**: Independent validator packages with common interfaces
**Rationale**:
- Each configuration type (ksail, kind, k3d) has unique validation rules and schemas
- Independent packages allow for isolated testing and development
- Follows Go package organization best practices
- Enables future extension for additional distributions (EKS, etc.)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single monolithic validator: Rejected due to complexity and testing difficulties
- Interface-based plugin system: Overkill for current scope, adds unnecessary complexity

### 2. Error Handling and Message Format

**Decision**: Structured ValidationError type with actionable messages
**Rationale**:
- Consistent error format across all validators improves user experience
- Structured errors enable better testing and debugging
- Actionable messages with fix examples reduce user frustration
- Follows constitution's User Experience Consistency principle

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple string errors: Rejected due to lack of structure and actionability
- Complex error hierarchies: Rejected due to unnecessary complexity for current scope

### 3. In-Memory Validation Strategy

**Decision**: Parse configuration into structs, then validate in memory
**Rationale**:
- Faster than file-based validation operations
- Easier to unit test without file I/O dependencies
- Marshalling errors naturally take precedence
- Meets performance requirements (<100ms)
- Enables snapshot testing of error messages

**Alternatives considered**:
- File-based validation with re-reading: Rejected due to performance and testing concerns
- Streaming validation: Overkill for typical config file sizes

### 4. Validation Timing and Integration Points

**Decision**: Validate during config loading in existing config-manager
**Rationale**:
- Fail-fast approach prevents invalid configurations from causing issues
- Natural integration point in existing codebase
- Consistent validation across all ksail commands
- Minimal changes to existing command structure

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate validation command: Rejected as it doesn't prevent runtime errors
- Validation on file write: Rejected as it doesn't catch manual file edits

### 5. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: TDD with unit tests per validator + integration tests
**Rationale**:
- Unit tests validate specific validation rules in isolation
- Integration tests validate complete validation workflows
- Snapshot testing ensures consistent error message format
- Mocking enables testing without file dependencies
- Follows constitution's TDD requirement

**Alternatives considered**:
- End-to-end testing only: Rejected due to slow feedback and complexity
- Property-based testing: Deferred as additional enhancement, not core requirement

### 6. Dependencies and External Libraries

**Decision**: Use existing project dependencies, no new external validation libraries
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing yaml parsing capabilities (sigs.k8s.io/yaml)
- Uses existing Kubernetes API types for kind/k3d validation
- Minimizes dependency bloat and security surface
- Follows constitution's dependency control requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- JSON Schema validation libraries: Rejected due to additional dependency and YAML focus
- Custom YAML parsing: Rejected due to reinventing existing functionality

### 7. Validator Independence and Coordination

**Decision**: KSail validator orchestrates, others are independent
**Rationale**:
- KSail validator handles ksail.yaml and coordinates loading other configs when needed
- Kind/K3d validators focus solely on their specific configuration format validation
- Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- Enables independent development and testing of each validator

**Alternatives considered**:
- Circular dependency between validators: Rejected due to complexity
- Central orchestrator separate from all validators: Rejected as unnecessary abstraction

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Aspect | Decision | Justification |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Architecture | Independent validator packages | Separation of concerns, testability |
| Error Handling | Structured ValidationError type | Consistency, actionability |
| Validation Strategy | In-memory after parsing | Performance, testability |
| Integration Point | During config loading | Fail-fast, consistency |
| Testing Approach | TDD with unit + integration tests | Constitution compliance |
| Dependencies | Use existing project deps | Minimize bloat, security |
| Coordination | KSail orchestrates, others independent | Clear responsibilities |

All decisions align with constitution requirements for code quality, performance, testing, and user experience.
