# Feature Specification: Configuration File Validation

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-validation-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add validation for configuration files, to ensure issues are highlighted for users, with actionable steps to fix their configuration files. The validation must be run whenever a config file is loaded, and fail in case the contents of the file is invalid with ksail or invalid in general. Marshalling errors should take precedence, such that validation can happen in memory, and not via read/write operations that are inefficient and hard to test."

## ⚠️ IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**CRITICAL**: This validation implementation MUST prioritize upstream Go package validators over custom validation logic. Use official APIs from:

- `sigs.k8s.io/kind` for Kind configuration validation
- `github.com/k3d-io/k3d/v5` for K3d configuration validation
- Existing KSail `v1alpha1.Cluster` APIs (DO NOT ALTER)

**DO NOT** implement custom validation logic that duplicates functionality already available in upstream packages. This ensures compatibility with official tools and reduces maintenance burden.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a KSail user, when I create or modify configuration files (ksail.yaml, kind.yaml, k3d.yaml, eks.yaml), I want immediate feedback about any errors or invalid configurations so I can quickly fix them before attempting cluster operations. The system should tell me exactly what's wrong and how to fix it, preventing wasted time on failed cluster operations due to configuration issues.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has an invalid ksail.yaml file with malformed YAML syntax, **When** they run any ksail command that loads the config, **Then** the system displays a clear error message indicating the YAML syntax error with line number and actionable fix instructions

2. **Given** a user has a ksail.yaml file with valid YAML but invalid field values (e.g., unsupported distribution name), **When** they run any ksail command, **Then** the system shows specific validation errors with allowed values and examples

3. **Given** a user has a kind.yaml file with conflicting configuration options, **When** ksail loads the Kind configuration, **Then** the system fails fast with detailed explanation of the conflict and suggested resolution

4. **Given** a user has valid configuration files, **When** they run any ksail command, **Then** validation passes silently and the command proceeds normally

5. **Given** a user has missing required configuration fields, **When** ksail loads the config, **Then** the system lists all missing required fields with examples of valid values

### Edge Cases

- What happens when configuration files are partially corrupted or contain non-UTF8 characters?
- How does system handle when a config file exists but is empty?
- What happens when required config files are missing entirely?
- How does validation behave with very large configuration files?
- What happens when there are circular references or infinite loops in configuration validation?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST validate all configuration files (ksail.yaml, kind.yaml, k3d.yaml, eks.yaml) whenever they are loaded during any command execution
- **FR-002**: System MUST prioritize marshalling/parsing errors before semantic validation to ensure efficient in-memory validation
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide actionable error messages that include specific field names, current values, expected values, and fix examples
- **FR-004**: System MUST fail fast when configuration validation errors are detected, preventing execution of potentially destructive operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate configuration schema compliance including required fields, data types, and value constraints
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate cross-field dependencies and constraints within configuration files
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate distribution-specific configuration requirements (Kind vs K3d vs EKS specific settings)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide detailed location information (file path, line number, field path) for all validation errors
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that configuration values are compatible with the target Kubernetes distribution capabilities
- **FR-010**: System MUST perform validation in memory without requiring file I/O operations for efficiency and testability

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Configuration validation MUST complete within 100ms for typical configuration files (< 10KB)
- **NFR-002**: Validation error messages MUST be human-readable and actionable by users with basic Kubernetes knowledge
- **NFR-003**: Validation logic MUST be unit testable without requiring file system operations
- **NFR-004**: Memory usage during validation MUST not exceed 10MB regardless of configuration file size

### Key Entities

- **ConfigurationFile**: Represents a configuration file (ksail.yaml, kind.yaml, etc.) with content, file type, and validation state
- **ValidationError**: Represents a specific validation failure with location, error type, current value, expected value, and fix suggestion
- **ValidationResult**: Contains the overall validation status and collection of any validation errors found
- **ConfigurationSchema**: Defines the expected structure, required fields, data types, and constraints for each configuration file type
- **FieldValidator**: Represents validation rules for individual configuration fields including type checking, range validation, and dependency validation
