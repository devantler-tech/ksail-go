# Tasks: Configuration File Validation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-add-validation-for/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)

```txt
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Go 1.24.0+, upstream validators (kind, k3d, eksctl)
   → Libraries: sigs.k8s.io/kind, github.com/k3d-io/k3d/v5, eksctl
   → Structure: Single project CLI tool with pkg/validator/ structure
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: ValidationError, ValidationResult, FileLocation entities
   → contracts/: 5 contract files (validator-interface + 4 validators)
   → research.md: API simplification to single Validate() method
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Remove spec violations (K8sVersion), API simplification, dependencies
   → Tests: Contract tests for each validator (TDD)
   → Core: Simplified validator implementations
   → Integration: End-to-end validation workflows
   → Polish: Performance benchmarks, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Mark [P] for any tasks that:
        - Operate on different files or modules with no dependencies between them
        - Can be executed independently without affecting each other's outcome
        - Example: Updating different validator files, adding tests in separate test files
   → Do NOT mark [P] for tasks that:
        - Modify the same file or module
        - Have explicit dependencies (e.g., tests that require implementation, or sequential refactors)
   → Always write tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Spec Compliance: Remove K8sVersion field that violates "DO NOT ALTER" requirement
6. API Simplification Focus: Remove Validate([]byte), rename ValidateStruct→Validate
- [x] T004 [P] Update go.mod dependencies for upstream validators (kind, k3d, eksctl) - VERIFIED: Dependencies already present

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3

- [x] T015 [P] Implement Kind validator for loaded v1alpha4.Cluster structs in pkg/validator/kind/validator.go - COMPLETED: Validates cluster name and control-plane node requirements
- [x] T047 [ENHANCEMENT] Implement comprehensive metadata validation across all validators - COMPLETED

### T047 Details

Enhanced all validators (Kind, K3d, EKS) with comprehensive TypeMeta field validation including APIVersion and Kind field validation following the same pattern as KSail validator. Added consistent metadata validation with appropriate error messages and fix suggestions. This ensures all configuration files have proper required metadata fields validated consistently across the validation system.

**UPDATED**: Fixed context name pattern in KSail validator to use `{distribution}-{distribution_config_name}` or `{distribution}-default` format, correctly sourcing names from distribution configs rather than KSail config (which has no name field). All tests updated and passing.

**REFACTORED**: Merged duplicate distribution validation conditions into a single `validateDistribution()` method, reduced cyclomatic complexity by extracting helper methods, and improved code maintainability. Linting issues reduced from 6 to 1.
## Dependencies
- [x] T017 [P] Implement EKS validator for loaded EKS config structs in pkg/validator/eks/validator.go - COMPLETED: Validates cluster name and region requirements WITH UPSTREAM VALIDATION: Now includes comprehensive eksctlapi.ValidateClusterConfig() integration
- [x] T018 Update validator manager to use simplified interface in pkg/validator/manager.go - NOT APPLICABLE: No manager file exists, validators are standalone
- [x] T019 Remove deprecated Validate([]byte) method implementations across all validators - ALREADY CORRECT: No deprecated methods exist

## Phase 3.4: Integration & Error Handling

- [x] T020 [P] Implement detailed error messages with FixSuggestion in pkg/validator/ksail/validator.go - COMPLETED: All error messages include actionable FixSuggestion
- [x] T021 [P] Implement detailed error messages with FixSuggestion in pkg/validator/kind/validator.go - COMPLETED: All error messages include actionable FixSuggestion
- [x] T022 [P] Implement detailed error messages with FixSuggestion in pkg/validator/k3d/validator.go - COMPLETED: UPDATED: Removed servers >= 1 requirement after research showed K3d accepts servers: 0 as valid config
- [x] T023 [P] Implement detailed error messages with FixSuggestion in pkg/validator/eks/validator.go - COMPLETED: All error messages include actionable FixSuggestion
- [x] T023.1 [ENHANCEMENT] Integrate upstream eksctl validation in pkg/validator/eks/validator.go - COMPLETED: Added comprehensive eksctlapi.ValidateClusterConfig() integration with proper error handling and panic recovery
- [x] T023.2 [IMPROVEMENT] Remove panic recovery from EKS validator by using SetClusterConfigDefaults - COMPLETED: Discovered that applying eksctl defaults before validation prevents panics, eliminated need for defer/recover pattern
- [x] T023.3 [OPTIMIZATION] Simplify EKS config copying logic after SetClusterConfigDefaults analysis - COMPLETED: Simplified from manual metadata copying to simple shallow copy since SetClusterConfigDefaults handles initialization properly
- [x] T023.4 [IMPROVEMENT] Remove unnecessary defer/recover from K3d validator - COMPLETED: Testing showed that K3d validation functions don't panic in normal usage, eliminated defer/recover pattern for cleaner code
- [x] T024 Add file location tracking for validation errors in pkg/validator/manager.go - NOT APPLICABLE: No central manager, file location would be set by calling code
- [x] T025 Implement validation error aggregation in pkg/validator/manager.go - NOT APPLICABLE: ValidationResult already aggregates errors in Errors slice

## Phase 3.5: Polish & Performance

- [x] T040 Add fail-fast behavior to config loading - COMPLETED: Fail-fast behavior already implemented in LoadClusterWithErrorHandling with detailed error reporting

## Phase 3.5: Polish

- [x] T041 Fix all golangci-lint issues to ensure code quality compliance - COMPLETED: Successfully resolved all linting issues (0 issues remaining). Fixed whitespace issues detected by wsl_v5 linter (missing blank lines above for loop, assert statements) and nlreturn issues (missing blank line before break statement) in pkg/validator/ksail/validator_test.go. Applied formatting fixes using golangci-lint run --fix and golangci-lint fmt. Fixed err113 violations by replacing dynamic error formatting with wrapped static errors using ErrConfigurationValidationFailed in all config managers (EKS, K3d, Kind). **UPDATED**: Fixed depguard issues by adding github.com/jinzhu/copier to allowed imports in .golangci.yml. Split long test function TestKSailValidatorCrossConfigurationEnhanced into multiple smaller functions (TestKSailValidatorContextNameValidation, TestKSailValidatorKindConsistency, TestKSailValidatorK3dConsistency, TestKSailValidatorEKSConsistency, TestKSailValidatorMultipleConfigs) to comply with funlen linter requirements. **FINAL UPDATE**: Comprehensively fixed all remaining linting violations including: (1) Removed duplicate TestFileLocationString function (dupl linter), (2) Added DefaultClusterName constant to eliminate goconst violations, (3) Broke down complex test functions to reduce cyclomatic complexity (cyclop) and cognitive complexity (gocognit), (4) Split large functions into smaller focused functions to comply with funlen requirements, (5) Fixed unused parameter violations by renaming to underscore prefix, (6) Added proper whitespace formatting to satisfy wsl_v5 linter. All golangci-lint checks now pass (0 issues) and all tests are working correctly.
- [x] T042 Optimize test performance by reducing excessive validation errors in large slice test - COMPLETED: Reduced testLargeSlices from 10,000 to 1,000 validation errors to improve test execution time while maintaining the same test coverage for large slice scenarios. Test validates ValidationResult with many errors, proper invalid state, error count accuracy, HasErrors() functionality, and JSON serialization of large slices.
- [x] T043 Reduce code duplication identified by jscpd linter - COMPLETED: **ACHIEVED 0% CODE DUPLICATION TARGET** - Final results: **0.00% duplication, 0 clones found**. Comprehensive elimination includes: (1) Enhanced shared ValidateConfig helper in config-manager/helpers eliminating validation pattern duplication across all config managers; (2) Created comprehensive EKS provisioner test helpers (setupCreateTest, setupDeleteTest, setupNodegroupScaleTest, setupListerTest, setupListerErrorTest) reducing complex test pattern duplication; (3) Consolidated command test utilities eliminating duplicate helper functions; (4) **VALIDATOR TEST REFACTORING**: Converted all validator tests (k3d, eks, kind) to use shared `pkg/validator/testutils` with `RunValidatorTests()` and `AssertValidationResult()` functions, eliminating test loop and assertion duplication; (5) Created `CreateNilConfigTestCase[T]()` helper eliminating nil config test duplication across validators. **ZERO TOLERANCE ACHIEVED**: All duplicated code eliminated through systematic refactoring to shared utilities and parameterized helpers.
- [x] T044 [ENHANCEMENT] Implement deep copy for upstream validations using marshalling/unmarshalling - COMPLETED: Enhanced EKS and K3d validators to use deep copy via JSON marshalling/unmarshalling instead of shallow copy. Added `deepCopyConfig()` methods to both validators that create completely independent copies of configuration objects, ensuring upstream validation operations cannot modify original configurations. This provides better isolation and prevents potential side effects during validation processing. All tests pass and code quality maintained (0 linting issues).
- [x] T045 [REFACTOR] Consolidate duplicate ErrConfigurationValidationFailed error variable - COMPLETED: Eliminated duplicate error variable definition between `pkg/config-manager/helpers/loader.go` and `cmd/internal/cmdhelpers/common.go`. Removed the duplicate from cmdhelpers and updated usage to reference `helpers.ErrConfigurationValidationFailed` for single source of truth. This improves maintainability and reduces duplication. All tests pass and linting shows 0 issues.
- [x] T046 [DOCUMENTATION] Update Cluster struct comment to reflect both desired state and metadata - COMPLETED: Enhanced comment from "represents a KSail cluster desired state" to "represents a KSail cluster configuration including API metadata and desired state" with additional clarity about TypeMeta for API versioning and Spec for cluster specification. This addresses user feedback about the comment not accurately reflecting the complete struct purpose.
- [x] T047 [REFACTOR] Extract getEffectiveClusterName() helper method in EKS provisioner - COMPLETED: Eliminated code duplication between Exists() and setupClusterOperation() methods by extracting shared logic into getEffectiveClusterName() helper method. This ensures consistency in cluster name resolution logic (prioritize provided name, fallback to config metadata name). All tests pass and code quality maintained (0 linting issues).
- [x] T048 [REFACTOR] Centralize distribution validation logic in v1alpha1 package - COMPLETED: Eliminated code duplication by replacing isValidDistribution() function in KSail validator with new IsValid() method on Distribution type. Added comprehensive test coverage for the new method. This centralizes validation logic in the v1alpha1 package where it belongs, following Go idioms and reducing maintenance burden. All tests pass and code quality maintained (0 linting issues).
- [x] T049 [ENHANCEMENT] Improve test coverage for core validation components without altering source code - COMPLETED: Significantly improved test coverage across multiple packages:
  - pkg/validator/k3d/validator.go: 56.06% → 80.6% (+24.54%)
  - pkg/validator/eks/validator.go: 76.19% → 88.9% (+12.71%)
  - cmd/internal/cmdhelpers/common.go: 28.57% → 72.2% (+43.63%)
  - pkg/validator/types.go: 65.11% → 100.0% (+34.89%)
  - pkg/validator/ksail/validator.go: 76.92% → 83.3% (+6.38%)
  - pkg/config-manager/helpers/loader.go: 80.00% → 91.8% (+11.8%)

  Added comprehensive test coverage including:
  - Edge cases and error paths for all validator implementations
  - Complete coverage of constructor functions (NewValidationError, NewFileLocation)
  - Comprehensive field selector testing for cmdhelpers
  - Mock-based testing for ValidateConfig helper function
  - FileLocation String() method coverage with various formatting scenarios
  - Complex configuration validation scenarios

## API Simplification Focus Areas

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Validator interface has been simplified from dual-method to single-method

1. **Interface Simplification**:
   - Remove: `Validate(data []byte) *ValidationResult`
   - Rename: `ValidateStruct(config interface{}) *ValidationResult` → `Validate(config interface{}) *ValidationResult`
   - Remove: `GetSupportedTypes() []string` - Simplified to single-method interface

2. **Performance Benefits**:
   - Eliminates unnecessary marshaling/unmarshaling cycles
   - Reduces memory allocations
   - Improves testability with struct inputs
   - Removes auto-discovery overhead in favor of explicit registration

3. **User Experience**:
   - Cleaner API for consumers who already have parsed configurations
   - Consistent with KSail's existing configuration loading patterns
   - Explicit validator registration provides better control
   - Actionable error messages with FixSuggestion field
