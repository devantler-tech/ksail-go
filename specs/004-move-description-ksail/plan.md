# Implementation Plan: Workload Command Restructure for Reconcile, Apply, Install

**Branch**: `004-move-description-ksail` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: [`spec.md`](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/ndam/git-personal/monorepo/projects/ksail-go/specs/004-move-description-ksail/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```text
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)


## Summary

Introduce a singular `ksail workload` command group that houses `reconcile`, `apply`, and `install` subcommands, provides consistent placeholder messaging ("Coming soon" + exit 0), removes the legacy root-level `reconcile` wiring, and appends a migration hint when the old entrypoint is invoked.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.24.0
**Primary Dependencies**: Cobra 1.10.1, Viper 1.21.0, internal `notify` UI helpers, go-snaps for snapshot testing
**Storage**: N/A (CLI wiring only)
**Testing**: `go test` with `testify` assertions and `go-snaps` snapshot fixtures
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI (macOS/Linux/Windows)
**Project Type**: Single CLI project (matches existing `cmd/`, `pkg/`, `internal/` structure)
**Performance Goals**: Adhere to constitution (<200 ms CLI response, <50 MB memory) — placeholder commands must remain lightweight
**Constraints**: TDD-first (tests before implementation), zero lint violations (`golangci-lint run` clean), maintain consistent help/UX messaging
**Scale/Scope**: Single developer workstation usage; small command tree expansion

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Code Quality Excellence**: Plan reuses existing command module pattern (`cmd/<group>`) to keep code cohesive, ensures gofmt + lint compliance, and limits scope to minimal wiring changes.
- **Testing Standards (TDD-First)**: New tests (snapshot + unit) will be created before command wiring updates; research notes define exact coverage areas.
- **User Experience Consistency**: Help text and placeholder messaging will conform to existing notify conventions and Cobra help formatting.
- **Performance Requirements**: Placeholder commands only print and exit, guaranteeing negligible latency/memory changes.

**Status**: PASS — no constitutional violations identified.

pkg/
└── ...                  # Business logic packages (untouched this feature)

tests rely on go test within cmd/, internal/, pkg/ using go-snaps snapshots.
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (single CLI project) — consistent with current repository layout.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

    ```text
    For each unknown in Technical Context:
       Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
    For each technology choice:
       Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
    ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: `/Users/ndam/git-personal/monorepo/projects/ksail-go/specs/004-move-description-ksail/research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

Prerequisite: research.md complete.

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `/Users/ndam/git-personal/monorepo/projects/ksail-go/specs/004-move-description-ksail/data-model.md`:
   - Document `WorkloadCommandGroup` plus the three placeholder subcommands.
   - Capture the legacy command migration behavior as an error-handling entity.

2. **Generate CLI contract** from functional requirements:
   - Map each command to expected messages and exit codes.
   - Output stored at `/Users/ndam/git-personal/monorepo/projects/ksail-go/specs/004-move-description-ksail/contracts/workload-cli.md`.

3. **Design test coverage**:
   - Snapshot updates for new help text (`cmd/__snapshots__`).
   - Unit tests asserting Notify output + exit codes for each subcommand and the legacy guidance path.

4. **Extract user journey validation steps**:
   - Quickstart instructions captured in `/Users/ndam/git-personal/monorepo/projects/ksail-go/specs/004-move-description-ksail/quickstart.md`.

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Executed `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` to record new tech context.

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/workload-cli.md, quickstart.md, updated agent context. Tests remain to be authored during implementation (per TDD plan).

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

This section describes what the /tasks command will do — do not execute during /plan.

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as the scaffold.
- Derive tasks from contracts and data-model:
   - Add snapshot + unit test tasks for each command behavior.
   - Add implementation tasks to wire the new `cmd/workload` package and remove legacy root command.
- Include documentation tasks (help text, quickstart validation) and lint/test runs.

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Enforce TDD: introduce failing tests for each command before wiring implementations.
- Sequence: tests → command constructors → root wiring → legacy guidance → documentation/help snapshots → lint/test gates.
- Mark independent test writing tasks as `[P]` for potential parallelization.

**Estimated Output**: ~15-18 ordered tasks in `tasks.md` (created by /tasks).

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command.

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
