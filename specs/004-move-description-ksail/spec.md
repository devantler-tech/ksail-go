# Feature Specification: Workloads Command Restructure for Reconcile, Apply, Install

**Feature Branch**: `004-move-description-ksail`
**Created**: September 28, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Move `ksail reconcile` to `ksail workloads reconcile`, and add `ksail workloads apply`, and `ksail workloads install`.

None of the commands needs an implementation in this spec, I just want them to exist in the CLI so I can iterate on them in a later spec.

The reconcile command will be responsible for triggering reconciliation tools to sync workloads with a cluster. The apply command will wrap the `kubectl apply` command, to allow applying local files. The install command will wrap the `helm install` command to allow installing helm charts.

The reason for this is to structure align the CLI more with the expectations users might have. Supporting more ways to work with ones workloads allows flexibility, and supporting a larger set of use cases."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28

- Q: How should the legacy top-level `ksail reconcile` command behave once the workloads namespace exists? â†’ A: Remove; show command not found.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A platform engineer using the ksail CLI wants workload-related operations grouped together so they can reconcile, apply, or install workloads from a consistent namespace without remembering disparate top-level commands.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an initialized ksail project, **when** the user runs `ksail workloads reconcile`, **then** the CLI must expose the command, show contextual help, and describe that it will sync workloads using the configured reconciliation tools.
2. **Given** a user with local Kubernetes manifests, **when** they invoke `ksail workloads apply --help`, **then** the CLI must explain that the command applies local files (future behavior) and outline required inputs.
3. **Given** a user planning to deploy a Helm chart, **when** they run `ksail workloads install --help`, **then** the CLI must present usage details indicating the intent to wrap Helm installations.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user runs `ksail workloads reconcile` without having a cluster context configured?
- How does the CLI guide users if required parameters (e.g., manifest paths, chart references) are missing?
- The CLI must return a clear "command not found" style message directing users to `ksail workloads reconcile` if they attempt the removed legacy top-level command.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The CLI MUST introduce a `workloads` command group that is discoverable via `ksail --help` and provides a summary of workload-related actions.
- **FR-002**: The CLI MUST expose `ksail workloads reconcile`, capturing the existing reconcile intent under the workloads namespace and clarifying that it orchestrates syncing workloads with a cluster.
- **FR-003**: The CLI MUST expose `ksail workloads apply` to position a future capability for applying local manifests (wrapping `kubectl apply`).
- **FR-004**: The CLI MUST expose `ksail workloads install` to position a future capability for installing Helm charts (wrapping `helm install`).
- **FR-005**: The CLI MUST update command help and documentation so users see the workloads namespace and its subcommands when requesting assistance or listing commands.
- **FR-006**: The CLI MUST remove the legacy top-level `ksail reconcile` command and surface a command-not-found style message that explicitly directs users to `ksail workloads reconcile`.
- **FR-007**: The CLI MUST communicate that detailed behaviors for `apply` and `install` will arrive in a future iteration while avoiding broken or misleading execution paths.
