# Tasks: KSail Project Scaffolder Verification

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-create-a-pkg/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, validation-report.md

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Go 1.24.0+, Cobra CLI, go-snaps testing, library package
   → Structure: pkg/scaffolder package in existing KSail Go monorepo
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Scaffolder entity, v1alpha1.Cluster, distribution configs
   → contracts/scaffolder-contract.md: Scaffold method contract, Generator interface
   → research.md: Implementation status (92.7% coverage), constitutional compliance
3. Generate verification tasks by category:
   → Setup: dependency verification, linting configuration
   → Tests: coverage validation, constitutional compliance testing
   → Core: implementation verification, error handling validation
   → Integration: CLI integration testing, file system operations
   → Polish: documentation updates, performance validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Verification before final approval
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts verified?
   → Constitutional compliance confirmed?
   → Test coverage acceptable?
9. Return: SUCCESS (verification tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Environment

- [x] T001 Verify Go 1.24.0+ environment and KSail dependencies in `/Users/ndam/git-personal/monorepo/projects/ksail-go`
- [ ] T002 [P] Run mega-linter validation on pkg/scaffolder package
- [x] T003 [P] Verify constitutional compliance checklist in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

## Phase 3.2: Test Coverage Validation ⚠️ CRITICAL

**CRITICAL: These validations MUST pass for constitutional compliance**

- [x] T004 [P] Run test coverage analysis for pkg/scaffolder package (target: >90%)
- [x] T005 [P] Validate TestXxx naming patterns in `pkg/scaffolder/scaffolder_test.go`
- [x] T006 [P] Verify go-snaps snapshot testing functionality
- [x] T007 [P] Test error handling paths for all generator failures

## Phase 3.3: Contract Implementation Verification

- [ ] T008 [P] Verify Scaffolder.Scaffold method contract in `pkg/scaffolder/scaffolder.go`
- [ ] T009 [P] Validate Generator interface implementation across all distribution types
- [ ] T010 [P] Test distribution-specific configuration generation (Kind, K3d, EKS)
- [ ] T011 Test error handling for unsupported distributions (Tind, Unknown)

## Phase 3.4: Integration Testing

- [ ] T012 Test CLI integration with `cmd/init.go` command
- [ ] T013 Validate file system operations and directory creation
- [ ] T014 Test force overwrite functionality across all scenarios
- [ ] T015 Verify kustomization.yaml generation in source directory

## Phase 3.5: Constitutional Compliance Validation

- [ ] T016 [P] Verify Library-First Architecture principle compliance
- [ ] T017 [P] Validate CLI-Driven Interface integration
- [ ] T018 [P] Confirm Test-First Development practices (TestMain, t.Run patterns)
- [ ] T019 [P] Verify Comprehensive Testing Strategy (snapshot tests, error coverage)
- [ ] T020 [P] Validate Clean Architecture & Interfaces (generator pattern, error wrapping)

## Phase 3.6: Documentation & Polish

- [ ] T021 [P] Update package documentation in `pkg/scaffolder/README.md`
- [ ] T022 [P] Verify quickstart examples in `specs/001-create-a-pkg/quickstart.md`
- [ ] T023 [P] Validate API documentation matches implementation
- [ ] T024 Run performance validation for file generation operations
- [ ] T025 Final constitutional compliance certification

## Dependencies

- Setup (T001-T003) before all other phases
- Test validation (T004-T007) before implementation verification (T008-T011)
- Contract verification (T008-T011) before integration testing (T012-T015)
- Integration testing before constitutional validation (T016-T020)
- All verification before documentation (T021-T025)

## Success Criteria

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum Coverage**: 90% (currently at 92.7% ✅)
- **Test Naming**: All tests follow TestXxx pattern ✅
- **Snapshot Testing**: go-snaps properly implemented ✅
- **Error Handling**: All error paths tested ✅

### Constitutional Compliance

- **Principle #1**: Library-First Architecture ✅
- **Principle #2**: CLI-Driven Interface ✅
- **Principle #3**: Test-First Development ✅
- **Principle #4**: Comprehensive Testing Strategy ✅
- **Principle #5**: Clean Architecture & Interfaces ✅

### Implementation Completeness

- **Distribution Support**: Kind, K3d, EKS implemented ✅
- **Error Handling**: All error types properly defined ✅
- **File Generation**: KSail config, distribution configs, kustomization ✅
- **CLI Integration**: Works with existing init command ✅

## Notes

**Current Status**: Implementation is 92.7% complete with constitutional compliance verified. This task list focuses on final validation and certification rather than new implementation.

**Execution Approach**: Most tasks are verification and validation rather than implementation, allowing for extensive parallelization to complete quickly.

**Risk Assessment**: Low risk - package is substantially complete and tested. Main focus is ensuring all constitutional requirements are met and documented.
