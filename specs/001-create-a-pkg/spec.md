# Feature Specification: KSail Project Scaffolder

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-pkg`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a pkg/scaffolder package capable of scaffolding a minimal ksail config file, a minimal distribution config file, and a simple kustomization file in the source directory."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input ✅
   → Feature description provided: scaffolding functionality for KSail project files
2. Extract key concepts from description ✅
   → Actors: KSail users, developers
   → Actions: scaffold/generate files
   → Data: config files, kustomization files
   → Constraints: minimal content, source directory placement
3. For each unclear aspect ✅
   → Marked specific clarifications needed below
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ✅
   → Clear user flow: initialize new KSail project
5. Generate Functional Requirements ✅
   → All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities ✅
   → Configuration files and their content structures
7. Run Review Checklist ✅
   → Some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] remain for complete specification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a platform engineer or developer, I want to initialize a new KSail project by generating the minimal required configuration files so that I can quickly set up a local Kubernetes development environment without manually creating boilerplate files.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an empty directory, **When** I run the scaffolding command, **Then** a minimal ksail config file is created with default settings
2. **Given** an empty directory, **When** I run the scaffolding command, **Then** a minimal distribution config file (e.g., kind.yaml) is created with default cluster configuration
3. **Given** an empty directory, **When** I run the scaffolding command, **Then** a simple kustomization.yaml file is created in the appropriate directory structure
4. **Given** a directory with existing files, **When** I run the scaffolding command, **Then** the system handles conflicts appropriately [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: overwrite behavior?]
5. **Given** invalid directory permissions, **When** I run the scaffolding command, **Then** the system provides clear error messages

### Edge Cases

- What happens when target directory already contains KSail configuration files?
- How does the system handle insufficient disk space or write permissions?
- What occurs if the user specifies an invalid or unsupported distribution type?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST generate a minimal ksail configuration file with default values for local development
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate a minimal distribution configuration file based on specified distribution type [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which distributions supported - Kind, K3d, others?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST create a simple kustomization.yaml file with basic structure and empty resources array
- **FR-004**: System MUST place generated files in the correct directory structure according to KSail conventions
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate target directory permissions before attempting file creation
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear feedback about which files were created successfully
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle file conflicts gracefully [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: overwrite strategy - prompt, force flag, error?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST support specification of distribution type [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: via CLI flag, config parameter, or auto-detect?]
- **FR-009**: Generated files MUST contain valid YAML syntax and proper structure for their respective tools
- **FR-010**: System MUST create any necessary parent directories in the target path

### Key Entities

- **KSail Configuration File**: Contains cluster settings, distribution preferences, and project metadata with minimal default values
- **Distribution Configuration File**: Contains distribution-specific cluster configuration (e.g., kind.yaml for Kind, k3d config for K3d) with sensible defaults for local development
- **Kustomization File**: Contains Kubernetes kustomization configuration with basic structure, empty resources array, and proper metadata
- **Target Directory**: The filesystem location where scaffolded files will be created, with proper permission validation
