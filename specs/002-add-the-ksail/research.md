# Phase 0: Research - KSail Init Command

## Research Areas and Decisions

### 1. CLI Framework and Patterns

**Decision**: Use existing cobra patterns from current KSail codebase

**Rationale**:
- Consistency with existing commands in the repository
- Leverages established `cmd/inputs` package for flag handling
- Follows constitutional requirement for user experience consistency
- Reduces learning curve for contributors familiar with current patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom CLI framework: Rejected due to inconsistency with existing codebase
- Different flag patterns: Rejected to maintain UX consistency per constitution

### 2. Scaffolding Architecture

**Decision**: Extend existing `pkg/scaffolder` package

**Rationale**:
- Code reuse and consistency with existing scaffolding functionality
- Leverages existing `v1alpha1.Cluster` APIs without alteration per spec constraints
- Maintains architectural patterns already established
- Follows constitutional code quality standards

**Alternatives considered**:
- New scaffolding package: Rejected due to code duplication
- Inline scaffolding logic: Rejected due to complexity and maintainability concerns

### 3. Template Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Use existing runtime template generation via pkg/io/generator system

**Rationale**:

- Leverages existing proven template generation architecture
- Ensures completely offline operation as required (FR-011)
- Eliminates need for embedded template maintenance
- Provides fast generation (<200ms performance target)
- Consistent with existing scaffolder implementation

**Alternatives considered**:

- Embedded templates in binary: Rejected due to existing runtime generation capability
- External template files: Rejected due to offline requirement
- Network-based templates: Rejected due to FR-011 constraint

### 4. Progress Feedback Implementation

**Decision**: Use spinner with file creation messages as clarified in spec

**Rationale**:
- Provides encouraging feedback per FR-005 requirement
- Balances informativeness with simplicity
- Meets 5-second performance constraint
- Follows clarification decision from specification

**Alternatives considered**:
- Silent operation: Rejected due to poor user experience
- Progress bar: Rejected as overly complex for 5-second operation
- Verbose logging: Rejected as potentially overwhelming for new users

### 5. Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Fail-fast with clear, actionable error messages

**Rationale**:
- Abort on conflicts unless --force flag used (clarified behavior)
- Provides actionable guidance per constitutional requirements
- Prevents data loss through conservative approach
- Enables easy troubleshooting for users

**Alternatives considered**:
- Interactive prompts: Rejected due to complexity and automation concerns
- Automatic backups: Rejected due to added complexity and disk usage
- Silent overwrites: Rejected due to data loss risk

### 6. Integration with Existing APIs

**Decision**: Use existing `v1alpha1.Cluster` APIs without modification

**Rationale**:
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Follows specification constraint "DO NOT ALTER existing APIs"
- Leverages existing validation and serialization logic
- Reduces testing surface area

**Alternatives considered**:
- New API structures: Rejected due to specification constraints
- API extensions: Rejected as unnecessary for init functionality
- Custom configuration format: Rejected due to consistency requirements

### 7. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: TDD with contract tests, unit tests, and integration tests

**Rationale**:
- Follows constitutional TDD-first requirement
- Contract tests ensure CLI interface stability
- Unit tests validate scaffolding logic with >90% coverage
- Integration tests verify complete user workflows

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing only: Rejected due to constitutional requirements
- End-to-end tests only: Rejected due to slow feedback and maintenance overhead
- Property-based testing: Deferred as additional enhancement beyond core requirements

### 8. Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Optimize for initialization speed and memory efficiency

**Rationale**:

- Runtime template generation provides fast access
- Minimal memory allocation during scaffolding
- Efficient file I/O operations
- Meets <5 second, <50MB constitutional requirements

**Alternatives considered**:

- Lazy template loading: Rejected due to added complexity
- Template caching: Rejected as unnecessary for single-use operation
- Streaming file writes: Rejected as overkill for small configuration files

## Implementation Readiness

All research areas have clear decisions with no remaining unknowns. The approach leverages existing codebase patterns and meets all constitutional and specification requirements. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 design phase.
