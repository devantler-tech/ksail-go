# Feature Specification: KSail Init Command

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-the-ksail`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add the ksail init command with intuitive and nice CLI UX (clear help text, actionable error messages, progress feedback, consistent flag patterns). This is important to make it easy for users to get started with ksail."

**UX Metrics Definition**: Intuitive CLI UX means:

- CLI response time <200ms (a constitutional requirement)
- Error messages include specific remediation steps (NFR-004)
- Progress feedback updates every <500ms during operations
- Help text follows consistent cobra patterns with examples
- Flag naming follows existing KSail conventions (--distribution, --force, etc.)

## Execution Flow (main)

```txt
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: CLI command for project initialization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: KSail users (developers, platform engineers)
   → Actions: Initialize new Kubernetes projects, scaffold configuration files
   → Data: Configuration files, project templates
   → Constraints: Must be intuitive, easy to use for beginners
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [No major clarifications needed - init command purpose is clear]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: User runs init in empty directory, gets working project
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Command execution, file generation, user feedback, error handling
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Project configuration, scaffold templates, CLI command interface
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Requirements testable, user-focused, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26

- Q: What should be the default Kubernetes distribution when user runs `ksail init` without flags? → A: Kind (local Docker-based clusters)
- Q: When `ksail init` detects existing project files, what should be the default conflict resolution behavior? → A: Abort with error message (safest, requires --force)
- Q: Which features should require network connectivity (if any) during `ksail init`? → A: None - completely offline operation always
- Q: Should `ksail init` provide different initialization experiences for different user types? → A: No - single unified experience for all users
- Q: What type of progress feedback should `ksail init` provide during the 5-second initialization? → A: Spinner with file creation messages

### Session 2025-09-26 (Analysis Refinements)

- Q: How does performance requirement align with constitutional <200ms CLI response time? → A: <200ms applies to CLI startup/validation, <5s applies to full project initialization
- Q: How does user specify different distributions? → A: Through `--distribution` flag accepting kind|k3d|EKS values
- Q: What specific next steps should be displayed? → A: Three specific commands: run ksail up, edit ksail.yaml, add manifests to k8s/
- Q: Should SOPS configuration be generated in this feature? → A: No - SOPS functionality will be implemented in a separate future specification

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

Any user (developer, platform engineer, or DevOps practitioner) wants to start using KSail for local Kubernetes development but doesn't know how to set up the initial project structure. They run `ksail init` in an empty directory and receive a fully configured project with all necessary files and clear next steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an empty directory, **When** user runs `ksail init`, **Then** system shows spinner with file creation messages, creates all required configuration files, and displays success message with next steps
2. **Given** a directory with existing KSail files, **When** user runs `ksail init`, **Then** system aborts with error message explaining --force requirement
3. **Given** user wants custom project settings, **When** user runs `ksail init` with flags, **Then** system respects those preferences in generated configuration
4. **Given** user runs init in existing KSail project, **When** command executes, **Then** system detects existing project and offers to update or recreate configuration
5. **Given** insufficient permissions to write files, **When** user runs `ksail init`, **Then** system displays clear error message explaining permission requirements

### Edge Cases

- **Insufficient disk space**: System detects available space before file creation and aborts with clear error message "Insufficient disk space (X MB required, Y MB available)" if less than 10MB available
- **Corrupted embedded templates**: System validates template integrity at startup and fails fast with error "Template corruption detected, please reinstall KSail" if templates are invalid
- **User interruption during init**: System implements atomic file operations and cleans up any partially created files on interruption (SIGINT/SIGTERM), leaving directory in original state
- **Invalid directory names or special characters**: System validates directory names against filesystem constraints and provides specific error messages for each violation (invalid characters, length limits, reserved names)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a `ksail init` command that scaffolds a new Kubernetes project
- **FR-002**: Command MUST create a `ksail.yaml` configuration file with Kind as the default distribution
- **FR-003**: Command MUST generate kind.yaml by default, with other distribution files (k3d.yaml, eks configs) generated when `--distribution` flag specifies k3d or eks
- **FR-004**: Command MUST create a basic Kustomize structure with `k8s/kustomization.yaml`
- **FR-005**: Command MUST display a spinner with "Initializing project..." text and show each file creation below the spinner with checkmark symbols (format: "✓ Created {filename}" for each generated file)
- **FR-006**: Command MUST offer customization options through specific CLI flags: --name (project name), --distribution (kind|k3d|talos), --reconciliation-tool (kubectl|flux), --force (boolean to overwrite existing files)
- **FR-007**: Command MUST pass --force flag to scaffolder to control file overwrite behavior (actual conflict handling varies by generator implementation)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support multiple Kubernetes distributions through `--distribution` flag accepting values: kind, k3d, talos
- **FR-009**: Command MUST display specific next steps as console output after successful initialization: "Next steps:" followed by numbered list: "1. Run `ksail up` to create cluster", "2. Edit ksail.yaml to customize", "3. Add manifests to k8s/"
- **FR-010**: Command MUST validate user inputs and provide actionable error messages for invalid options
- **FR-011**: Command MUST work completely offline with no network dependencies for any initialization features
- **FR-012**: Command MUST provide comprehensive help text explaining all available options
- **FR-013**: Command MUST detect insufficient disk space (< 10MB available) and abort with specific error message showing required vs available space (breakdown: 2MB for ksail.yaml, 3MB for distribution configs, 2MB for k8s/ structure, 3MB safety margin)
- **FR-014**: Command MUST validate runtime template generation integrity at startup and fail fast if template generation fails
- **FR-015**: Command MUST handle user interruption (SIGINT/SIGTERM) gracefully by cleaning up partial files and restoring original directory state
- **FR-016**: Command MUST validate directory names against filesystem constraints and provide specific error messages for violations

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Performance - CLI command startup and validation MUST respond within 200ms, full project initialization MUST complete within 5 seconds for typical projects (constitutional requirements)
- **NFR-002**: Memory Usage - Operation MUST consume less than 50MB of memory during execution (constitutional requirement)
- **NFR-003**: Reliability - All file operations MUST be atomic to prevent partial state on interruption
- **NFR-004**: Usability - Error messages MUST be actionable and include specific remediation steps
- **NFR-005**: Compatibility - Generated files MUST be compatible with existing KSail command suite and Kubernetes standards

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Project Configuration**: Represents the KSail project settings including name, distribution choice, and feature selections
- **Scaffold Template**: Represents the file templates and directory structure used to generate new projects
- **CLI Command Interface**: Represents the command-line interface including flags, arguments, and user interaction patterns
- **Distribution Config**: Represents the specific configuration files needed for each Kubernetes distribution (Kind, K3d, Talos)

### Scope Boundaries *(what's included and excluded)*

**Included in this specification**:

- Basic project initialization with `ksail init` command
- Support for Kind, K3d, and Talos distributions
- Basic Kustomize structure generation
- File conflict detection and --force override capability
