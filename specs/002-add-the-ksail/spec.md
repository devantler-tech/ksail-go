# Feature Specification: KSail Init Command

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-the-ksail`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add the ksail init command with intuitive and nice CLI UX. This is important to make it easy for users to get started with ksail."

## Execution Flow (main)

```txt
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: CLI command for project initialization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: KSail users (developers, platform engineers)
   ‚Üí Actions: Initialize new Kubernetes projects, scaffold configuration files
   ‚Üí Data: Configuration files, project templates
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must be intuitive, easy to use for beginners
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [No major clarifications needed - init command purpose is clear]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User runs init in empty directory, gets working project
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Command execution, file generation, user feedback, error handling
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Project configuration, scaffold templates, CLI command interface
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Requirements testable, user-focused, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26

- Q: What should be the default Kubernetes distribution when user runs `ksail init` without flags? ‚Üí A: Kind (local Docker-based clusters)
- Q: When `ksail init` detects existing project files, what should be the default conflict resolution behavior? ‚Üí A: Abort with error message (safest, requires --force)
- Q: Which features should require network connectivity (if any) during `ksail init`? ‚Üí A: None - completely offline operation always
- Q: Should `ksail init` provide different initialization experiences for different user types? ‚Üí A: No - single unified experience for all users
- Q: What type of progress feedback should `ksail init` provide during the 5-second initialization? ‚Üí A: Spinner with file creation messages

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

Any user (developer, platform engineer, or DevOps practitioner) wants to start using KSail for local Kubernetes development but doesn't know how to set up the initial project structure. They run `ksail init` in an empty directory and receive a fully configured project with all necessary files and clear next steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an empty directory, **When** user runs `ksail init`, **Then** system shows spinner with file creation messages, creates all required configuration files, and displays success message with next steps
2. **Given** a directory with existing KSail files, **When** user runs `ksail init`, **Then** system aborts with error message explaining --force requirement
3. **Given** user wants custom project settings, **When** user runs `ksail init` with flags, **Then** system respects those preferences in generated configuration
4. **Given** user runs init in existing KSail project, **When** command executes, **Then** system detects existing project and offers to update or recreate configuration
5. **Given** insufficient permissions to write files, **When** user runs `ksail init`, **Then** system displays clear error message explaining permission requirements

### Edge Cases

- What happens when disk space is insufficient for file creation?
- How does system handle corrupted or missing embedded templates?
- What occurs if user interrupts the init process mid-execution?
- How does system behave with invalid directory names or special characters?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a `ksail init` command that scaffolds a new Kubernetes project
- **FR-002**: Command MUST create a `ksail.yaml` configuration file with Kind as the default distribution
- **FR-003**: Command MUST generate kind.yaml by default, with other distribution files (k3d.yaml, talos configs) only when explicitly specified
- **FR-004**: Command MUST create a basic Kustomize structure with `k8s/kustomization.yaml`
- **FR-005**: Command MUST display a spinner with "Initializing project..." text and show each file creation below the spinner
- **FR-006**: Command MUST offer customization options through CLI flags (name, distribution, reconciliation tool, etc.)
- **FR-007**: Command MUST detect existing project files and abort with clear error message unless --force flag is used
- **FR-008**: Command MUST provide a `--force` flag to overwrite existing files when explicitly requested
- **FR-009**: Command MUST display helpful next steps after successful initialization
- **FR-010**: Command MUST validate user inputs and provide actionable error messages for invalid options
- **FR-011**: System MUST support multiple Kubernetes distributions (Kind, K3d, Talos)
- **FR-012**: System MUST optionally generate SOPS configuration for secret management
- **FR-013**: Command MUST complete initialization within 5 seconds for typical projects
- **FR-014**: Command MUST work completely offline with no network dependencies for any initialization features
- **FR-015**: Command MUST provide comprehensive help text explaining all available options

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Project Configuration**: Represents the KSail project settings including name, distribution choice, and feature selections
- **Scaffold Template**: Represents the file templates and directory structure used to generate new projects
- **CLI Command Interface**: Represents the command-line interface including flags, arguments, and user interaction patterns
- **Distribution Config**: Represents the specific configuration files needed for each Kubernetes distribution (Kind, K3d, Talos)
