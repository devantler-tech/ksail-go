# KSail-Go Documentation

This repository hosts Markdown-only documentation rendered directly in GitHub. The `docs/` tree mirrors the structure of the original KSail project and is organized by topic so you can browse or link to specific guidance.

## Directory layout

- `overview/` – Product overview, architecture, project structure, and support matrix.
- `configuration/` – CLI flag reference, declarative configuration guides, and precedence rules.
- `use-cases/` – Scenario playbooks covering learning, local development, and CI/CD pipelines.
- `images/` – Shared diagrams used across the guides.

Each folder contains additional `README`-style index pages to help you navigate deeper.

## Need help?

If you encounter issues, have questions, or want to suggest improvements to the documentation, please open an issue or start a discussion in the repository.
