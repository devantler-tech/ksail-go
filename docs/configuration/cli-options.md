# CLI Options

The KSail-Go CLI exposes the same configuration surface everywhere: strongly typed flags that feed into `ksail.yaml`. Run `ksail <command> --help` to see the latest options, or use the quick references below when you need to remember which flag overrides which field.

## Quick reference

```bash
ksail --help                     # Top-level commands
ksail cluster init --help        # Project scaffolding flags
ksail cluster create --help      # Runtime overrides for an existing config
ksail cluster delete --help      # Clean-up options
ksail cluster connect -- --help  # Pass-through flags to k9s (note the `--`)
```

## Shared cluster flags

The cluster subcommands (`init`, `create`, `start`, `stop`, `delete`, `list`, `connect`) all bind to the same underlying configuration manager. Flags map directly to fields inside `ksail.yaml`, environment variables prefixed with `KSAIL_`, and sensible defaults.

> **Environment variables:** Viper replaces dots (`.`) and hyphens (`-`) with underscores, so any field in `ksail.yaml` can be overridden with `KSAIL_<UPPERCASE_PATH>`. For example, `KSAIL_SPEC_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=10m` sets the optional timeout even though there is no dedicated flag.

## Command reference

### `ksail cluster init`

Creates a new project in the current directory (or in `--output`). The command writes `ksail.yaml`, `kind.yaml`, and optional `k3d.yaml`, then seeds the Flux-ready `k8s/` tree.

- `--source-directory` controls where generated workloads live (`k8s` by default).
- `--cni` accepts `Default`, `Cilium`, or `Calico`. The value is stored in `ksail.yaml` for future `create` runs.
- `--metrics-server` toggles installing the Kubernetes metrics-server controller (`Enabled` / `Disabled`).
- `--gitops-engine` reserves space for future GitOps integrations (currently `None`).
- `--mirror-registry host=upstream` can be repeated to preconfigure local registry mirrors (for example `docker.io=https://registry-1.docker.io`).
- `--force` overwrites existing files, and `--output` chooses the target directory.

### `ksail cluster create`

Reads the committed configuration and provisions a cluster. Every flag listed in the shared table is available, plus:

- `--mirror-registry host=upstream` creates (or reuses) Docker registries before provisioning, then attaches them to the cluster network.
- `--metrics-server` lets you override the value stored in `ksail.yaml` when you need a one-off run.

The command automatically loads distribution configs (`kind.yaml` or `k3d.yaml`) and installs the requested CNI and metrics-server after the core cluster boots.

### `ksail cluster start` and `ksail cluster stop`

Resume or pause an existing cluster without rebuilding it. Both commands honour `--distribution`, `--distribution-config`, `--context`, and `--kubeconfig` so you can point at an alternate project directory or kubeconfig during operations.

### `ksail cluster delete`

Destroys the cluster defined in `ksail.yaml` and removes any mirror registries that were created. Use `--delete-registry-volumes` when you want Docker volumes cleaned up as well.

### `ksail cluster list`

Shows the clusters currently managed by the selected distribution. Add `-a`/`--all` to query every supported distribution, even if it differs from the one in `ksail.yaml`.

### `ksail cluster info`

Proxies directly to `kubectl cluster-info`. Any arguments you pass are forwarded to `kubectl`, so standard flags such as `--context` or `--namespace` work as expected.

### `ksail cluster connect`

Launches [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) against the distribution and context defined in `ksail.yaml`. Add `--` before k9s flags to avoid Cobra parsing them (`ksail cluster connect -- --namespace flux-system`).

## Workload and cipher commands

Other command groups (`ksail workload`, `ksail cipher`, and the generators under `ksail workload gen`) inherit Kubernetes-native semantics. They forward all flags to the underlying tooling (`kubectl`, Helm, or SOPS), so rely on the upstream help output for exhaustive flag listings. The configuration rules above still apply: any cluster-related override you set for lifecycle commands carries across to workload reconciliation and secret management.
