- Address golangci-lint findings for mirror registry feature: err113/static errors, wrapcheck, nosprintfhostport.
- Reduce complexity in create.go helpers (prepareKindConfigWithMirrors, prepareK3dConfigWithMirrors, setup/connect flows) by extracting shared helpers.
- Refactor pkg/svc/provisioner/cluster/registry to add package comments, shrink SetupRegistries, simplify ExtractRegistryPort conditional tree.
- Update docker registry manager to remove unused parameters and lower DeleteRegistry complexity.
- Shorten oversize tests (registry tests) using table-driven helpers; switch to registries_test package where flagged.
- After refactors, rerun golangci-lint and jscpd to ensure clean output.
