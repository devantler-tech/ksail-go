# GitHub git authentication URL pattern (not a real URL to check)
# This pattern is used in git push commands for authentication
# Lychee extracts this as "https://x-access-token/" from the auth string
https://x-access-token/

# Docker registries use Docker Registry HTTP API V2 and don't respond to bare GET requests
