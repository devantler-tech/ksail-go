## How to Create These Issues

Since GitHub CLI is available but not authenticated in this environment, you can create these issues using one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/devantler-tech/ksail-go/issues/new
2. Select the "chore" template (if available)
3. Copy the title and body content from each issue above
4. Add the specified labels
5. Submit the issue

### Method 2: Using GitHub CLI (if authenticated)

```bash
# For each package, run:
gh issue create \
  --repo devantler-tech/ksail-go \
  --title "chore: refactor pkg/<package-name> package" \
  --label "chore,refactor,package:<package-name>" \
  --body "<paste body content here>"
```

### Method 3: Using GitHub API

```bash
# For each package, run with proper authentication:
curl -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/devantler-tech/ksail-go/issues \
  -d '{
    "title": "chore: refactor pkg/<package-name> package",
    "body": "<paste body content here>",
    "labels": ["chore", "refactor", "package:<package-name>"]
  }'
```
