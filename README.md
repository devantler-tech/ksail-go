# ksail

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a work in progress to migrate KSail to a Golang. This is a huge endeavour, but being able to leverage the power of the Go ecosystem will be invaluable. The amount of packages available in Go to support this project is immense, so switching programming language has the potential to greatly enhance the functionality, performance and ease of use of KSail. I also hope switching will promote adoption and contributions.

Take control of Kubernetes without the chaos. âš¡ KSail is your all-in-one SDK for spinning up clusters and managing workloadsâ€”right from your own machine. Instead of juggling a dozen CLI tools, KSail streamlines your workflow with a single, declarative interface built on top of the Kubernetes tools you already know and trust.

ðŸŒŸ Declarative. Local. Effortless. Welcome to Kubernetes, simplified.
