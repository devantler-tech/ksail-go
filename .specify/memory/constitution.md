# KSail-Go Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence

All code MUST meet strict quality standards without exception. Zero tolerance for linting violations, formatting inconsistencies, or technical debt accumulation. Every commit MUST pass golangci-lint with zero issues, maintain 100% gofmt compliance, and follow Go best practices. Code reviews MUST verify quality gates before approval.

Rationale: As a developer tool managing critical Kubernetes infrastructure, KSail-Go requires absolute reliability and maintainability. Poor code quality directly impacts user trust and system stability.

### II. Testing Standards (TDD-First)

Test-Driven Development is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Tests MUST be written before implementation, following the strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle. All public APIs require contract tests, all business logic requires unit tests with >90% coverage, and all integrations require end-to-end tests. No feature ships without comprehensive test coverage.

Rationale: Managing Kubernetes clusters involves complex state management and critical operations. Comprehensive testing prevents production failures and ensures reliable behavior across diverse deployment scenarios.

### III. User Experience Consistency

CLI interface MUST provide consistent, predictable user experience. All commands follow cobra patterns with unified flag naming, consistent output formats (human-readable + JSON), clear error messages with actionable suggestions, and comprehensive help documentation. Breaking changes require major version bumps and migration guides.

Rationale: Users rely on KSail-Go for critical infrastructure operations. Inconsistent interfaces cause confusion, errors, and reduced productivity. Consistency builds user confidence and adoption.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Operations MUST complete within defined performance thresholds: cluster validation <100ms, configuration loading <50ms, CLI response time <200ms, memory usage <50MB during normal operations. All performance-critical paths require benchmarking and optimization. Resource consumption MUST be measured and optimized continuously.

Rationale: KSail-Go operates in developer workflows where performance directly impacts productivity. Slow tools disrupt flow state and reduce adoption. Performance requirements ensure responsive, efficient operations.

## Quality Gates

All code changes MUST pass these mandatory gates before merge:

- golangci-lint run returns zero issues
- go test ./... achieves >90% coverage with all tests passing
- Performance benchmarks meet defined thresholds
- Manual testing of CLI workflows completes successfully
- Documentation updates accompany feature changes

## Development Standards

Technology constraints and requirements:

- Go 1.24+ required for all development
- Dependencies MUST be justified, minimized, and actively maintained
- All public APIs MUST include comprehensive godoc documentation
- Error handling MUST provide actionable user guidance
- Logging MUST use structured formats with appropriate levels
- Configuration MUST support both file-based and environment variable inputs

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All pull requests MUST demonstrate compliance with these principles. Violations require either immediate correction or explicit constitutional amendment through the defined process.

Amendment procedure: Proposed changes require documented rationale, impact analysis, and approval from maintainers. Breaking changes require migration planning and user communication.

Compliance review: All features undergo constitutional compliance review during design phase and implementation review. Non-compliance blocks release until resolved.
