# pkg/apis/cluster/v1alpha1

This package contains Kubernetes API definitions for cluster resources version v1alpha1.

## Purpose

Defines the API schemas and types used for representing cluster configurations and resources in KSail. These types follow Kubernetes API conventions and are used for defining cluster specifications in a declarative manner.

## Usage

This package is typically imported by other components that need to work with cluster API definitions:

```go
import "github.com/devantler-tech/ksail-go/pkg/apis/cluster/v1alpha1"
```

The types defined here are used for marshalling and unmarshalling cluster configurations, and for type-safe interactions with cluster resources.
