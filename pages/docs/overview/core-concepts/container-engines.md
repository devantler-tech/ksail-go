# Container Engines

`Container Engines` refer to the underlying container engine on which a supported Kubernetes Distribution is spun up.

## Docker

[`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/) is a widely used container engine for creating and managing containers. It is supported on all major operating systems. It is the default container engine used by KSail.

## Podman

[`Podman`](https://podman.io/) is a container engine that is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Docker. It is daemonless and can run containers without requiring a background service. Podman is supported on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
