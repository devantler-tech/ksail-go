# Editor

The `Editor` is your choosen text editor, which is used by KSail when it spawns a new process to edit files. This is necessary for e.g. `ksail secrets edit`, and `ksail connect` when you want to edit a server-side kubernetes resource.

## Nano

The `Nano` editor is a simple and easy to use text editor that is available on most Linux distributions. It is a good choice for users who are not familiar with more complex text editors like `Vim` or `Emacs`. It is also a good choice for users who want a simple and lightweight text editor that does not require any configuration. `Nano` is the default editor for KSail.

## Vim

The `Vim` editor is a powerful and flexible text editor that is available on most Linux distributions. It is a good choice for users who are familiar with it, and who want a powerful text editor that can be customized to their needs. `Vim` is not the default editor for KSail.
