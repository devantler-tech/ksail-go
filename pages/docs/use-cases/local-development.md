# Local development

The primary use case for KSail is to provide a local development environment for Kubernetes. It allows Platform Engineers and DevOps Engineers to build their clusters locally, before deploying them to production. This is particularly useful for testing and debugging configurations, as well as for developing new features or applications.

It is recommended that you create a local development environment that closely resembles your production environment. This will help you towards achieving a great developer experience, where the feedback loop is fast, and any changes can be built and validated locally before sharing them with your team.
This is especially important for teams that are working on complex applications or microservices, as it allows them to test their changes in a realistic environment before deploying them to production.

Ultimately a local Kubernetes cluster improves the developer experience by providing a consistent and reliable environment for testing and development, while also reducing the risk of errors and downtime slipping through to production.
